# Semantria SDK for JavaScript

The [Semantria](https://www.lexalytics.com/semantria) SDKs are the most convenient way to integrate with the Semantria API to build a continuous or high-volume application. The SDKs implement all available Semantria features and include some simple examples of their use. However, the examples are not intended to demonstrate the best practices for processing large volumes of data. Please contact Lexalytics for guidance if you plan to build your own application.

For small volume, or ad-hoc, interactive data exploration check out [Semantria for Excel](https://www.lexalytics.com/semantria/excel).

Signup for a free trial [here](https://www.lexalytics.com/signup).

See [semantria.readme.io](https://semantria.readme.io/docs/) for complete API documentation.
