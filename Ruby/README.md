# Semantria SDK for Ruby

The [Semantria](https://www.lexalytics.com/semantria) SDKs are the most convenient way to integrate with the Semantria API to build a continuous or high-volume application. The SDKs implement all available Semantria features and include some simple examples of their use. However, the examples are not intended to demonstrate the best practices for processing large volumes of data. Please contact Lexalytics for guidance if you plan to build your own application.

For small volume, or ad-hoc, interactive data exploration check out [Semantria for Excel](https://www.lexalytics.com/semantria/excel).

See [semantria.readme.io](https://semantria.readme.io/docs/) for complete API documentation.

## Installation

First, clone or download the SDK from https://github.com/Semantria/semantria-sdk.

Change directory into the Ruby directory. Then build the gem:

    $ gem build semantria.gemspec

Install the gem:

    $ gem install semantria_sdk-4.2.86.gem


### Testing

We use the minitest testing framework. To install it:

    $ gem install minitest

To run the SDK tests, first set the environment variables SEMANTRIA\_KEY and SEMANTRIA\_SECRET with your key and secret.

Then run the tests:

    $ ruby test/unittests.rb

## Running the examples

There are several example programs in the examples subdirectory.

First, ensure the environment variables SEMANTRIA\_KEY and SEMANTRIA\_SECRET are set.

Then run an example (the detailed example in this case):

    $ ruby examples\detailed_mode_test_app.rb

Remember, these examples are coded in a simple style to illustrate the use of some of Semantria features. They do not represent the best practices for processing large volumes of data.
